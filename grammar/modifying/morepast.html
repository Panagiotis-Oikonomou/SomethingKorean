            <div class="examples">
                아빠가 먹던 피자.<br>
                1. The pizza that dad was eating (but hasn't finished yet).<br>

                2. The pizza that dad was used to eat on a regular basis (not anymore).<br>

                3. The pizza that dad has been eating regularly/up to this time (you're not sure wheter he'll continue to eat that pizza on a regular basis).
            </div><hr>
            <p>So you can notice that Verb-던 has mainly three usages:</p>

            <div class="examples">
                1. An action that started in the past but hasn't ended yet.<br>

                2. An action that one used to do continuously (and not anymore).<br>

                3. An action that one's been doing continuously up to this time (but will not likely continue. Also used when you're not sure whether one will continue doing that action).
            </div>
            <div class="extra">If your sure that it will continue use Verb-는</div>
        </div>
