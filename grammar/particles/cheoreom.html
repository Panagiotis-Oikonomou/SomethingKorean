            <p>-처럼 is used when comparing actions or qualities and is often placed after a noun. It describes how something is (similar in nature or quality) to something else.</p>
            <p> -같은 is used to describe things or people that are similar or identical to something else. It can be translated as &quot;the same as&quot;, &quot;similar to&quot;, or &quot;like&quot; in some contexts. -같은 can be used after a noun to indicate that something or someone is of the same kind or category as another.</p>
            <p>-처럼 focuses more on comparing qualities or actions (e.g., &quot;like&quot; in terms of appearance, behavior, or characteristics). -같은 is used to show that something is exactly the same or similar in terms of category or class.</p>
